[Arduino-Sketches/Master](./Arduino-Sketches/Master) - The Arduino Sketch for the Arduino that is located inside the store and collects data.    
[Arduino-Sketches/Slave](./Arduino-Sketches/Slave) - The Arduino Sketch for the Arduino that recieves data from the store and allows a farmer to access the data. Also controls the ambient display.    
[Website-Farmer](./Website-Farmer) - The interface where the farmer can view all data in detail (In adition to an ambient display)    
[Website-Exhibition](./Website-Exhibition) - A demo site that showcases most of the functionality and guides a user though the concept.
